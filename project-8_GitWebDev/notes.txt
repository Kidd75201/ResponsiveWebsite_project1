* Lean about CSS organization
-- Where you have multiple .css file that are then combined into one master .css file
-- ex. header.css, footer.css, features.css into styles.css

* Learn about Package Management
-- 

------------------ NODE.js Intro ---------------------------------
* In the project directory run npm init -y to create the package.json file (package recipe file)
* run npm install lodash to add lodash as a dependency in the package.json file
* run sudo npm install normalize.css to add normalize.css as a dependency in the package.json file
* If you happen to delete the node_modules directory you can run 'npm install' to create a new file based on the
    package.json recipe file.
* You can search on npm.com to find a package that may help resolve a project issue that you may have.
-- Or google what you would like to do and add npm at end of search string.
